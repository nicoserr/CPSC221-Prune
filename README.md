# Prune Algorithm For Images for CPSC 221 2021W *

This is an algorithm that was completed as part of an algorithms course. It takes an image and prunes it by combining pixels whose characteristics (in this case, Hue, Saturation, Luminosity and Alpha) are similar. The similiarity can be set to any positive value; the higher it is, the more lenient the algorithm is in grouping pixels together.
